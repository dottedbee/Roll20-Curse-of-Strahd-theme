This is my attempt at writing a Curse of Strahd inspired css for roll20.net.
Designated to be used with the Stylish extension ON FIREFOX.
Works ONLY with the dark mode enabled.
Just take whichever file you need (firefox-roll20-cos-mini.css may or may not work but the other one is safe), and upload it to stylish. 
Works well enough on firefox 110.0, character sheet and scrollbars don't work on Chrome, but I'll fix that one day.
I didn't publish it on Stylish because it's an  ̶a̶l̶p̶h̶a̶  (sadly there's nothing before alpha) version.
Don't try to read it, it's very bad.

God bless this mess.


I don't own Curse of Strahd. Obviously.
